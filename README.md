# LS-MCPP
This repository is the benchmark and implementation of the algorithms for the graph-based multi-robot coverage path planning problem from the following two papers:

- Branch master: *Jingtao Tang, Zining Mao, and Hang Ma. "Large-Scale Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning on Grids with Path Deconfliction." [[paper]](https://arxiv.org), [[project]](https://sites.google.com/view/lsmcpp)

- Branch aaai24: *Jingtao Tang and Hang Ma. "Large-Scale Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning via Local Search." AAAI 2024. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10797.pdf), [[simulation]](https://vimeo.com/894744842)*, [[project]](https://reso1.github.io/blog/posts/grid_mcpp)

Please cite us if you use this code for the multi-robot coverage path planning problem.

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
```bash
python main.py [-h] [--init_sol_type INIT_SOL_TYPE] [--prio_type PRIO_TYPE] [--M M] [--S S] [--gamma GAMMA] [--tf TF] [--scale SCALE] [--write WRITE] [--verbose VERBOSE] istc
```
- Required:
  - `istc`: the instance name stored in directory 'data/instances' or 'MIP-MCPP/data/instances'.
- Optional:
  - `--init_sol_type INIT_SOL_TYPE`: Initial solution type. Choose from {VOR, MFC, MSTCStar, MIP} (default=MFC)
  - `-prio_type PRIO_TYPE`: Operator sampling type. Choose from {Heur, Rand} (default=Heur)
  - `--M M`: Max iteration (default=3e3)
  - `--S S`: Forced deduplication step size (default=100)
  - `--gamma GAMMA`: Pool weight decaying factor (default=1e-2)
  - `--tf TF`: The final temperature used to calculate the temperature decaying factor
  - `--scale SCALE`: Plot scaling factor
  - `--verbose VERBOSE`: Is verbose printing
  - `--write WRITE`: Is writing the solution
  - `--record RECORD`: Is recording the path costs of each iteration
  - `--draw DRAW`: Is drawing the final solution
  - `--random_remove RANDOM_REMOVE`: Is randomly making 20 percentage of terrain vertices incomplete
